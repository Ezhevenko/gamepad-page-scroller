## Gamepad Navigation for Chrome

A Google Chrome extension that lets you scroll pages and change a website’s zoom level using a gamepad.

## Features

- Scroll up/down and left/right with either analog stick — speed depends on stick deflection.
- The D-pad acts like the keyboard arrow keys, with auto-repeat while held.
- Rear triggers decrease/increase the page zoom.

## Installation

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the repository folder.
4. After loading, open any page and use your gamepad to navigate.
